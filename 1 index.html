 <h1> HAJEE MOHAMMAD DANESH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY </h1>
</head>
<body>
   <p>
    Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU) which is the first Science and Technology University in the northern region of Bangladesh. It stands away from the urban din and bustle at a beautiful and scenic location some 13 km north of Dinajpur town by the side of the intercity highway that links Dinajpur to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. I feel great pleasure in expressing my heartiest congratulations and best wishes for the gradual but steady development of the HSTU, Dinajpur.</p>
    <p>
It is a matter of satisfaction for us that the university has made steady progress in a relatively short period of time in terms of expansion of its physical infrastructure and academic programmes. The HSTU has been growing rapidly in terms of quality, recognition, activities, number of courses, student intake, staff, outreach and research during the recent years. The university provides multidiscipline education. We have eight faculties such as Agriculture, Computer Science and Engineering, Business Studies, Fisheries, Engineering, Veterinary and Animal Science, Science, Social Science and Humanities and one Post-graduate Studies. Now we have 45 departments under nine faculties including post graduate studies. Presently 195 international students (undergraduate-179 and postgraduate-16) are studying in this university; they are from Nepal, Bhutan, India, Djibouti, Nigeria and Somalia. We are proud for our international students as the number is the highest among the public universities in Bangladesh.

<p>
In the continuing task of nation building, HSTU is trying to promote excellence in higher education for a vibrant and inclusive society through knowledge creation and dissemination. It is making sincere efforts to contribute its mite by providing the right kind of human resources. It is striving hard to impart quality education to meet national and global challenges, towards accomplishing its mission. For students, the degree represents certification of competence, and a passport to advanced education or gainful employment, and livelihood and prosperity.
